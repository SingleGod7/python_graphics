# Graphics algorithm in python
This repository aims to implement the graphics algorithm using python jupyter notebook.

First of all, I want to implement a rasterization render like [tinyrender](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer).

- [line algorithm](./rasterization/Lesson1-Bresenham's_line_drawing_algorithm.ipynb)
- triangle rasterization
- hidden faces removal
- perspective projection
- moving camera
- shaders
- tangent space normal mapping
- shadow mapping
- ambient occlusion
- real opengl application

Then I will use this as a basic idea go through deepper like raytracing, pathtracing, fliud simulation etc.
